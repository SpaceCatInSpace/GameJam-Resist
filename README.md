# GameJam-Resist

# Core Features: 
Basic player movement; jumping, crouching?, walking? with sounds

When caught instant gameover? No violence or anything was the plan
    When things like security cameras spot the player do we spawn NPCS? Or Instant gameover too? Need to discuss
    May not have time for decent AI

Static/path based AI. We could make a cone visible to the player indicating where different AI can see

A half decent 'Quarry' Tileset for the starting area.
If we plan to continue this after the gamejam I think we should do what we can and have it polished for continueing. 
Not worrying about finishing it completely for the deadline?

Quarry map will have to have alot of verticality, lots of climbing and what not as we are limited where our player can actually go anyway

# Potential Features we really really want
'Blend' feature that allows the player to go undetected while in crowds/Darks areas. The player could slightly fade out to indicate
when blended in. //This could be done with an invisible box covering areas we dont want to be detected by.

Physiscs system. Push boxes to jump on and what not

That holding cell idea. Release prisoners for extra support.

Have a counter showing how many supporters we have? Could have different endings depending on how much supporters we have.
