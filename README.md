# GameJam-Resist

Developers: 
    Emily (Emz), 
    Jon (PrinsesseJ), 
    Jack (SpaceCatInSpace)
# Core Features: 

    - Stealth-Pacifism
    - Rudimentary player movement such as walking, running, jumping etc.
    - When the player is caught they will be imprisoned, level restarts
    - Security cameras are important symbolically and in game mechanics as they will detect "suspicious" behaviour and alert guards who will attempt to find you. (Although the AI guards may not be amazing due to time contraints)
    - Patrolling guards will attempt to seek out suspicious activist behaviour and destroy it
    - 'Quarry' Tileset sourced for the starting area.

# Potential Features we really really want

    - Environment blending, the player appears to conform or hide from guards, lower opacity or something to indicate this allowing for some extra stealthy ability!
    - Interactive world! Boxes that can be moved around, perhaps things dropping from above?!
    - Fellow activists fear not! We will hopefully release you so you can go annoy the guards as we slip through unseen.
    - A little GUI counter system to display the amount of support our actions have gained! If it is too negative, game over - you probably aren't cut out for progressive and peaceful activism. (Perhaps witnessed acts of violence/destruction could cause the counter to lower?!)
    - Maps to not be confined and to be somewhat vertical, perhaps include some secret little bits-n'-bobs?

The game may continue being developed even though it was initially planned for a quick Game-jam (Projects are fun and cool!)
